The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to BitcoinKit, which are hosted in the [Yenom Organization](https://github.com/yenom) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this code. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

* Use English.

## Where Can I Ask a Question?
You can ask a question on github issues at any time. We'll soon launch a Slack group to ask a question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Please provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

* List some **other implementations where this enhancement exists.**
* Specify which **version of BitcoinKit** you're using.
* Specify **the name and version of the OS** you're using.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to BitcoinKit? You can start by looking through these `beginner-welcome` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner-welcome] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
